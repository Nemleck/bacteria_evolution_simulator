The red things are [bacterias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria), they try to survive from the [phagocytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte). They turn green if they see one of them.

**They don't reproduce themselves**

The purple things are phagocytes. They run after the bacterias and try to eat them.
